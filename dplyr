## dplyr functionality

* Five basic verbs: `filter`, `select`, `arrange`, `mutate`, `summarise` (plus `group_by`)
* Can work with data stored in databases and [data tables](http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/)
* Joins: inner join, left join, semi-join, anti-join (not covered below)
* Window functions for calculating ranking, offsets, and more
* [Better than plyr](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/01/17/introducing-dplyr/) if you're only working with data frames (though it doesn't yet duplicate all of the plyr functionality)
* Examples below are based upon the [latest release](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/releases), version 0.2 (released May 2014)


## Loading dplyr and an example dataset

* dplyr will mask a few base functions
* If you also use plyr, load plyr first
* hflights is flights departing from two Houston airports in 2011

```{r}
# load packages
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(hflights)

# explore data
data(hflights)
head(hflights)
```

* `tbl_df` creates a "local data frame"
* Local data frame is simply a wrapper for a data frame that prints nicely

```{r}
# convert to local data frame
flights <- tbl_df(hflights)

# printing only shows 10 rows and as many columns as can fit on your screen
flights
```

```{r results='hide'}
# you can specify that you want to see more rows
print(flights, n=20)
