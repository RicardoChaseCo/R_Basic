#The tbl, pronounced tibble, is a special kind of data frame

#If using RStudio, output for a tibble adjusts to your window size, tibble display better

#subset
class(data[,2])
#> [1] "numeric"

#tibbles will give you a warning if you try to access a column that does not exist.
murders$Population 
#> NULL

#tibbles can have complex entries, such as list and function
tibble(id = c(1, 2, 3), func = c(mean, median, sd))

#create a tibble
 grades <- tibble(names = c("John", "Juan", "Jean", "Yao"), 
                  exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),
                  exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90))
#To convert a regular data frame to a tibble, you can use the as_tibble function
