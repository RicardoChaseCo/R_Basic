# Learn data analysis using R

*Contents are summerised by myself primarily from books, github projects, medium posts and RStudio materials

*some code are editted with runing results with R Studio, others are only the codes without the result return


## Part 1 Math_in_R

This part is about how to apply basic math calculation with R functions

## Part 2 R_Language

This part is about some special functions used in R
- create a sequence
- repeat data to enlarge the data size
- sort
- vector related: length, subset, extract, basic mathematical operations
- matrix related: create, combine data, subset, extract, extract diagonal, omit, overwrite, transpose
- linear Algebra in matrix: multiplication, inversion
- array related: subset
- relational operators
- logical operators: 'logical is number', 'use logical to subset'
- index position
- string related: create, concatenation, match, subset
- levels related: create, check, relabel, cut
- list related: create, rename, extract, check size, add data
